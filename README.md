DISCLAIMER — MUST READ
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains documentation and conceptual material intended strictly
for use by cybersecurity professionals performing authorized, legal testing in
controlled environments (e.g., private labs, authorization from asset owners,
C.R.A.F.T. engagements, or coordinated vulnerability disclosure programs).

I DO NOT provide, host, or distribute exploit code, encoders, or instructions to
bypass security controls. I am NOT responsible for misuse of any information.
Any testing performed without explicit authorization is illegal and unethical.

By using anything described in this repository you confirm you have explicit,
written permission from the system owner and that you will follow local laws,
employer policies, and responsible disclosure practices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OVERVIEW (high level)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository documents a conceptual proof-of-concept (PoC) workflow used by
security analysts to study interactive remote shells and detection techniques.

Purpose:
- To educate defenders and auditors about how remote interactive shells function.
- To provide safe guidance on setting up a contained test lab for detection tuning,
  endpoint hardening, and EDR/AV evaluation without endangering real systems.
- To describe networking concepts such as TCP forwarding in the context of PoC
  network topologies.

What this repo DOES NOT contain:
- Any runnable exploit payloads, obfuscation/encoding scripts, or bypass techniques.
- Step-by-step instructions to compromise or persist on systems.
- Any materials intended to assist unauthorized access.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INTENDED AUDIENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Security engineers and analysts running authorized red-team / blue-team tests.
- Researchers studying endpoint behavior and telemetry in controlled labs.
- Students learning about networking and secure testing methodologies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREREQUISITES (for a safe lab only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before doing any testing in a lab, ensure:
- You have written authorization from the owner of the systems you will test.
- You work within an isolated network environment (air-gapped or virtual network).
- All test machines are disposable VMs or devices, not connected to production.
- Logging, monitoring, and snapshots are enabled so you can revert and analyze.
- You understand and adhere to applicable laws and institutional policies.

Note: Do not deploy code described in this documentation on production systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAFE LAB SETUP (recommended, high level)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a self-contained lab that mimics attacker and victim roles:

1. Attacker host (isolated VM): used only for test tooling and analysis.
2. Victim host(s) (isolated VM(s)): target(s) for detection exercise — keep snapshots.
3. Network: a private virtual network connecting attacker and victim VMs only.
4. Instrumentation: enable packet capture, host process monitoring, and EDR/AV
   telemetry collection for both sides so you can record behavior.

Keep all lab assets offline or behind an isolated virtual network segment that
cannot reach the Internet or other internal networks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY (non-actionable)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Read the conceptual sections to understand the test objectives and risks.
- Use the lab setup guidance to prepare isolated VMs and monitoring.
- Design test cases that simulate interactive remote access but do not use real
  payloads from the wild. Prefer known benign simulators or purpose-built safe
  tooling that does not exploit or persist on the target.
- Instrument and capture telemetry during each test for analysis and detection
  rule development.

If you are documenting a PoC for a private report, keep any sensitive artifacts
offline and only share them with stakeholders under a non-disclosure agreement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ETHICS, LAWS, AND RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Always obtain prior written authorization from asset owners.
- If you discover a legitimate vulnerability, follow a coordinated disclosure
  process and avoid public release until proper mitigation is available.
- Maintain logs and evidence of authorization for all tests.
- Use this material only for defensive research, education, and authorized
  security testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIMITATIONS & RISKS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- This documentation is educational. It does not replace formal training or legal
  counsel for red-team engagements.
- Misuse of techniques discussed elsewhere (outside this doc) can cause harm,
  data loss, or legal liability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TCP FORWARDING — EXPLANATION & DIAGRAM (conceptual)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is TCP forwarding?
- TCP forwarding (also called port forwarding) is the technique of relaying TCP
  connections from one network endpoint to another. It is used legitimately for
  NAT traversal, secure tunnels, and remote access tools.
- In controlled testing, forwarding can be used to illustrate how an interactive
  session is proxied across network boundaries for telemetry analysis.

Common conceptual uses:
- Forwarding a local port to a remote host to allow a tester to connect to a
  service behind a NAT or firewall (in a lab scenario).
- Creating an intermediary relay that sits between two hosts for analysis.

     |                                |                              |

     |                                |                              |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High-level flow:
1. The attacker connects to a local port exposed on Host A.
2. Host A forwards the connection to the relay/bastion.
3. The relay forwards to the victim host on the private lab network.
4. All traffic stays within the isolated lab for recording and analysis.

Important: In real operational environments, any forwarding or proxying can
introduce security risks. Use only in isolated labs and with authorization.

CONTACT & REPORTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are a vendor, defender, or asset owner and you believe you have found a
vulnerability related to materials you received from me, contact me privately at:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL WARNING (PLAIN)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This documentation is for education and authorized testing only. Do not use
these concepts to attack, compromise, or harm systems you do not own or have
explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access is illegal and punishable by
law. I will not assist or be responsible for misuse.
