## ⚠️ Disclaimer — MUST READ

This repository is intended strictly for **educational purposes** and **authorized lab testing only**.
It is designed for **cybersecurity professionals** working in **isolated lab environments**.

**Important:**

* ❌ No real exploits, payloads, or bypass code are included.
* ❌ I am **not responsible** for misuse of any concepts described here.
* ✅ Only run simulations on machines you **own or have explicit authorization to test**.

By using this repository, you confirm that you comply with all **local laws and organizational policies**.

## 💾 Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/safe-lab-sim.git
cd safe-lab-sim
```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Usage (Safe Lab Simulation)

1. **Simulate Python encoding workflow:**

```bash
python encode.py --input sample_script.py --output encoded_script.py
```

2. **Simulate a network listener (safe local simulation):**

```bash
python simulate_listener.py --port 9000
```

> All commands are **safe**, local, and intended for **lab simulations only**.

## 🌐 TCP Forwarding — Conceptual Explanation

TCP forwarding is the technique of **relaying network traffic** from one endpoint to another.
In a safe lab, this can be used to **simulate network routing and traffic analysis**.

### Safe Lab Example Diagram

> The diagram illustrates how traffic flows between simulated attacker and victim hosts in an isolated environment.
> All traffic remains local; nothing is transmitted over the Internet.

## 📝 Lab Simulation Tips

* Use **snapshotted virtual machines** for attacker and victim hosts.
* Always test with **benign scripts or simulated payloads**.
* Enable **logging, monitoring, and packet capture** to analyze activity.
* Keep all lab machines **isolated from the Internet**.
* Review each simulation **before running** to ensure it is safe and controlled.

## ⚡ Final Warning

This repository is for **education and professional lab use only**.
Do **not** apply these concepts on machines you **do not own or have explicit permission to test**.
Unauthorized access is illegal and punishable by law.
I will **not** be responsible for misuse.
